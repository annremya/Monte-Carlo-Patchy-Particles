A repository of Fortran codes for Monte Carlo Simulations of Inverse Patchy Colloids (IPCs) in the NPT Ensemble in 2D coordinates.

Three Initial configuration set ups are discussed:
  1. Random initial configuration
  2. Restart from a previous configuration 
  3. Lattice initial configuration using
    - Hexagonal close packed lattice
    - Square close packed lattice

Comment out the MC Vol subroutine in equilibration and production subroutines to perform simulations in the NVT Ensemble.
